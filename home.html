<H1><u><br>Top Female Political Leaders In The History Of India.</u></H1>
<p><br>From the past few years, women have stepped out from their comfort zone and have acquired esteemed
positions and reputation in almost every field such as civil services, corporate world, or even politics.
India women have been into politics since ages. It is very difficult to be a part of the political arena, 
especially while doing a campaign. The opponents and their supporters continuously watch each activity with
the hope that a mistake will be committed. From women’s point of view, they not only have to face such
hardships but will also have to manage the stress based on their gender and the customs that go along with
being a female. Despite all such pain, the world has witnessed some powerful Indian female politicians of 
all time. More than one in every two Indians say that "women and men make equally good political leaders"
and over one in every ten believe women generally make better political leaders than men, according to a 
recent survey. India has had powerful female politicians, with some of them managing to ascend to top
political posts nationally and regionally, including president and prime minister. In a country like India, 
it becomes even more difficult for a female politician as caste, creed and religion play decisive role in 
Indian politics. It's true that most of the successful women politicians in this country owe their success 
to their family's political background; nevertheless, nobody can deny them the credit for putting in hard 
work and displaying requisite acumen for not only surviving but carving a separate niche for themselves.
Modern India has witnessed emergence of many such female politicians.n India, reform movements before and after 
independence has helped women to gain some power in politics also. After independence they have achieved an 
unprecedented political break­through with the reservation of seats for them in panchayats and other public 
bodies.It is heartening to note that Indian women were among the earliest to get their political rights (right 
to vote)without any political movement like in die United States and many Western countries. They were among 
the foremost to take active part in politics even in pre-independence times.Indian women have a distinction to 
become UNO Secretary (Vijay laxmi Pandit), Prime Minister (Indira Gandhi), Chief Minister (Sucheta Kriplani.
Women in politics have made significant progress in recent years, although they continue to face challenges and 
obstacles. Women are underrepresented in political leadership roles around the world, despite accounting for 
half of the population.One of the key challenges facing women in politics is gender discrimination and bias. 
Women often face stereotypes that suggest they are less competent than men in leadership positions, which can 
limit their opportunities to advance in their political careers. Additionally, women may face barriers to 
accessing funding and resources needed to launch and run a political campaign.Despite these challenges, women 
have made significant strides in recent years. In many countries, women have gained access to political 
leadership positions, including the presidency, prime minister, and other high-level positions. Many countries 
have also adopted measures to promote gender equality in political leadership, such as quotas and affirmative 
action policies.Overall, women's participation in politics is essential for achieving gender equality and 
ensuring that women's voices and perspectives are represented in decision-making.<br><br>
